# Renata Thomazelli's Portfolio

## About Me

Hi there! I'm a Data Analyst and Python Developer passionate about transforming data into intelligent solutions. After more than a decade in the tax field, I transitioned into the world of technology and data science — where I found purpose in solving real-world problems through impactful analysis, models, and visualizations.

Currently, I work with tools such as Python, Power BI, Microsoft Fabric, SQL, PySpark, and other modern data and cloud platforms.

## 🎯 Portfolio Purpose

This repository showcases practical projects that reflect my technical growth, creativity, and analytical skills in both real and simulated environments. Each project includes a brief description, technologies used, and a link to the source code.
